# Analysing-the-Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability
In this Project, the client has asked How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and
product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?
As a Data Analyst, my work revolves around analyzing patterns in the various Car features to
understand the factors that drive consumer demands for Cars. These insights will be helpful
for Car manufacturers, dealers, and other stakeholders to determine the important factors
to boost sales of Cars.
